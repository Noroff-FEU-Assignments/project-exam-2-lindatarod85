# TweeMe - Social Media Platform

## Description
TweeMe is a new social media platform built with React, designed to connect people and foster meaningful interactions in a user-friendly environment. Users can register, login, and customize their own profile with an avatar and banner image. They can publish posts, edit, and delete their own posts, as well as view and interact with other users' posts by commenting and posting reactions with a selected emoji. Users can also view other users' profiles and follow/unfollow them.

### Motivation
The aim of TweeMe is to provide a safe and engaging space for people to connect, be inspired, and interact with each other. We believe in the power of technology to bring people together and promote positive interactions, and TweeMe is our contribution towards that goal.
